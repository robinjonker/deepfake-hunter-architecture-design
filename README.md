## This is an architecture design project relating to creating a platform to detect deepfakes.

### Abstract: 

The rise of deepfake technology and the threats they present is a challenge for society.
Possibly malicious media files getting spread across social media, which is practically impossible for
humans to detect, exposes society to mass misinformation. The purpose of this project is to design
an AI-enabled software platform for detecting deepfakes on the Internet. This platform is designed
to be a user-friendly free-to-use tool that allows anyone to detect the authenticity of media files.
Driving principles in the design relates to its social, economic, and environmental impacts along
with ensuring its scalability and maintainability. A cloud computing solution is selected using the
powerful Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem of technologies. AWSâ€™s services ensure the platform
and the data it receives is extremely secure. A full-stack platform with a Python backend and React
frontend along with defined testing outcomes is designed. Deep learning methods such as convolutional
neural networks with the specific EfficientNet architecture and the S3FD detector for image and video
detection along with the WaveFake architecture for audio detection are selected as the optimal models
to process the media files using the AWS SageMaker service. This platform has a net zero carbon
policy with distinct processing reduction features. The platform with its open-source technologies and
income generation strategies focuses on long-term sustainability with crowdsourcing inputs to remove
biases within the model creating a sense of hybrid intelligence.

### Project Result

I am proud to have achieved 95% for the project.
